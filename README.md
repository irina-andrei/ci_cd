# CI/CD

### what is CI/CD?

**CI/CD is considered as the backbone of DevOps practices and automation**. It plays a vital, challenging and exciting role in DevOps culture, growing numbers of companies releasing software in minutes with the adoption of CI/CD practices.

* **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Developers merge/commit code to master branch multiple times a day, fully automated build and test process which gives feedback within few minutes. By doing so, you avoid the integration hell that usually happens when people wait for release day to merge their changes into the release branch.

* **Continuous Delivery** is an extension of *continuous integration* to make sure that you can release new changes to your customers quickly in a sustainable way. This means that on top of having automated your testing, you also have automated your release process and you can deploy your application at any point of time by clicking on a button. In Continuous Delivery the deployment is completed **manually**.

* **Continuous Deployment** goes one step further than *continuous delivery*. With this practice, every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers - **there is no human intervention** and only a failed test will prevent a new change to be deployed to production.

### Why use it?

Approximately 2400 companies reportedly use CICD pipelines in their tech stack (including Facebook, Netflix, and Instacart) predominantly to gain the benefits of **faster software builds**, **customer satisfaction** by deploying the app in time and **Small code changes make fault isolation simpler and quicker**.

### What is Jenkins?

Jenkins is an **open-source automation server** in which the central build and CI process take place. It is a Java-based program with packages for Windows, macOS & Linux.
